# Covid-19 Contacts

## Programming project for Algorithms and Data Structures course

This program simulates a simple social networks themed around the current Covid-19 pandemic
(let's hope Trump isn't lying about the cure). Users can add others as contacts, create/join groups,
post messages (which are sent to all contacts and groups with the main purpose of notifying others if they're infected)
and of course, receive messages.

## Implemented data structures

The data structures that are implemented in Java that accompany this work are:

* AVL Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* Chained Hash Table
* Doubly and Singly Linked Lists
* Array List
* Queue
* Stack
